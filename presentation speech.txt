Slide 1
Thanks Arvin. For our first research question, we decided to investigate the difference between the runners official times and their Boston qualifying times. This will allow us to see whether the runners perform better when qualifying or when running the Boston marathon.

Slide 2
This figure displays the percentage of runners who beat their BQ times and those that did not. The majority of runners seem to perform worst compared to their time to qualify. Another interesting observation is that for each age group there is very little difference between the sexes. It should also be noted that the younger runners are closer to 50% while the older runners fare much worst.

Slide 3
We performed the Welch's t-test for each age group and each sex. The t-test will determine whether the runners official times is lower than the BQ standard. With close to 100% confidence, we can say no group had a mean of official time lower than their BQ standard.

Out of all the age groups, the 18-34 women performed the best with 5 minutes difference between their official time and BQ time while the worst age groups are all runners aged 50+ with a difference larger than 14 minutes.

Slide 4
Why might runners perform worst on the race day compared to qualifying? Well, the Boston marathon is a challenging, hilly course. Runners may also try to maximize their chance of qualifying by running a fast, flat course. This is the complete opposite of the Boston marathon.

The time difference between runners gaining entry and race day is 6 months. During this time period, you may not know you have been qualified and therefore you may not train as hard due to the uncertainty. The weather is also a big factor due to it being warm.

All these factors may affect the runners performance on the actual day itself.
