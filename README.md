# slimeVolleyball

## Description
Slime volleyball, a game where the objective is to hit the ball back and forth over a volleyball net. This is not just the game that is coded but also a neural network that can train and attempt to play slime volleyball. Uses some genetic programming in order to evolve the weights in the NN

This is a class project and is unlikely to be completed. Everything was coded from scratch, except for a few starter code here and there. Feel free to fork and use this base template
